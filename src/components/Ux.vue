              <p class="text project-part__intro">At the time I was quite interested in retro effects and old 8 bit videogames so I built a moodboard based on this. My main references were <strong>FITC // Toronto 2016 Teaser</strong> by Giant Ant, <strong>DDD + OFFF Italy 2016 Main Titles</strong>  by Nerdo and <strong>Adobe Make It Titles</strong> by Never Sit Still. I also did a wink to league of legends adding Poros, sweet little creatures.</p>

              <p class="text project-part__intro">Simultaneously with the modeling part, I started my designboard and compositing. I wanted to create a mysterious atmosphere and build tension until the drop where the 8-bit menu shows up. I imagined 3 phases: [1] Screen saver, [2] Terminal and [3] 8-bit menu in game.</p>

              <p class="text project-part__intro">Once the styleframes felt good, I prepared my assets inside Photoshop and started rendering in Cinema 4D. Animate the titles was quite time-consuming but I have been rewarded by the results and kept going. The audio was the trickiest… To bring life to my animation, the audio was essential but it was hard to find the exact sound which fit both movements and atmosphere. </p>
