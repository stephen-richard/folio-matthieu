I wanted my square to feel heavy to bring impact when it hits the floor and something very simple to make the logo shows up. So I did a cell filling [Now that I’m looking back at it, an animation a bit longer wouldn’t have hurt]. As usual, it took me some times to tweak my curves until the animation feels right.",

I also really love the ambiances created by <strong>Beeple</strong> in his everyday shots: each frame tell a short story I'm trying to imagine raising questions: What is this world ? Where is it ? Why this man is watching a machine ? etc. And loving the works of <strong>Ashthorp</strong>, I could'nt prevent my self to add it in. Each of his works are a journey trough different universe with unknown adversities and with awesome visuals.",
